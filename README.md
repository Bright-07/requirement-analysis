Requirement Analysis in Software Development
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining what the software system must accomplish. It ensures developers understand what users and stakeholders need before development begins. This phase is crucial in the SDLC because it lays the groundwork for successful design, implementation, and deployment.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- ðŸŽ¯ **Avoids scope creep** by clearly defining boundaries early.
- ðŸ§  **Reduces misunderstanding** between developers and stakeholders.
- ðŸš€ **Ensures successful delivery** of a system that meets expectations.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

-  **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting information via interviews, surveys, etc.
-  **Requirement Elicitation**: Refining and discovering hidden needs through brainstorming.
-  **Requirement Documentation**: Creating detailed specs, user stories, and use cases.
-  **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Structuring and validating requirements visually or logically.
-  **Requirement Validation**: Getting stakeholder confirmation and approval.
## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Describe what the system should do.

Examples:
- Users can register and log in
- Admins can manage properties
- Guests can book listings

###  Non-functional Requirements
Describe how the system should perform.

Examples:
- Load time should be under 2 seconds
- Support for 10,000 users concurrently
- High-level security with HTTPS and encryption
## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams show how users (actors) interact with the system. They help in understanding system functionalities and user roles.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, customer, or other stakeholder. They define the scope, boundaries, and requirements for a user story or feature to be considered complete.

### Why is it Important?
- Clarifies expectations and avoids misunderstandings
- Serves as the basis for testing and validation
- Ensures stakeholder satisfaction

### Example: Checkout Feature in Booking System

**Feature**: Guest can book and pay for a property

**Acceptance Criteria:**
-  The user must be logged in to access the checkout page.
-  The booking summary should be displayed before confirming payment.
-  The system must validate the availability of the property.
-  Secure payment must be processed using an integrated payment gateway.
-  A confirmation email is sent after successful booking.
